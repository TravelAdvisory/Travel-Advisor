# Travel Advisor

The purpose of this site is to connect travelers with up-to-date news and safety information about any locations that they are wanting to visit. When the user first lands on the page, they will be prompted to enter a location, and we sent the input to several different APIs to return travel alerts, recent news, and an interactive map.
